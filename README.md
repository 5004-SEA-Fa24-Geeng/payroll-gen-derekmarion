(Optional) How would you improve the assignment?

* I found that the autograder was very fussy for this assignment. After developing a working and well-tested solution locally, it took me many hours struggling with the autograder to determine why it was failing. If code needs to be implemented in a specific way to pass autograded test suites, it would be helpful to have more precise specifications for implementation. In this case, because the requirements were not very specific, I was able to produce a solution that was not testable by the autograder even though it fulfilled the requirements and was well tested locally.
